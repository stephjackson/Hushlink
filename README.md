Hushlink is a social media service where user communication is limited to posting links to other web pages into their own news feeds, which other users can follow.

Hushlink users can use the bottom navbar to post links to a feed. The left sidebar is dedicated to user information - viewing your own posts, followers, who you're following, and you can change your user icon to your favorite chess piece.

The right sidebar is for finding users - you can see all users on the service, and it will show you some random users to investigate, along with footer information.

A user's profile page will let you view their posts, followers, and followees from a header.

The information from the sidebars is contained in the dropdown menu on the mobile version.
